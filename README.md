A dark, medium-contrast colorscheme for vim, inspired by my (other) favourite colorscheme: [`apprentice`](https://github.com/romainl/Apprentice), by Romain Lafourcade.

This colorscheme is a slight higher contrast, for ease of viewing when there is more surrounding light, or some glare.

It also explicitly sets a few extra markdown options.

The colour palette is taken from the xterm colour palette to ensure consistency across 256 and higher colour environments.

Here's some markdown in terminal MacVim:
