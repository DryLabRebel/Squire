Squire

A dark, medium-contrast colorscheme for vim, inspired by one of the best colorschemes around: Apprentice, by Romain Lafourcade.

The pallette is heavy on low contrast blues and greens, with splashes of yellow and purple, and off-white text.

The goal was to end up with something similar to apprentice, only with a slightly higher contrast against the background and more earthy tones.

Moreover, I wanted a little more explicit control of some features, in particular some markdown features.
